    /*NOTE:
  Where you place your Suspense boundaries will depend on a few things:

    1.How you want the user to experience the page as it streams.
    2.What content you want to prioritize.
    3.If the components rely on data fetching.

  :You could stream the whole page with loading.tsx... but that may lead to a longer loading time if one of the components has a slow data fetch.
  :You could stream every component individually... but that may lead to UI popping into the screen as it becomes ready.
  :You could also create a staggered effect by streaming page sections. But you'll need to create wrapper components.

  -Where you place your suspense boundaries will vary depending on your application. In general, 
    it's good practice to move your data fetches down to the components that need it, and then wrap those components in Suspense. 
  -But there is nothing wrong with streaming the sections or the whole page if that's what your application needs.
